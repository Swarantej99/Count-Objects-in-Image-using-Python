# Count-Objects-in-Image-using-Python

This project showcases a simple approach to detect and count objects within an image. By leveraging the `cvlib` library, which is built on top of `OpenCV` and `TensorFlow`, we can perform object detection with minimal code.

## Features

- Detects multiple objects in an image
- Counts specific objects (e.g., number of cars)
- Displays the image with bounding boxes around detected objects
- Utilizes pre-trained models for object detection
